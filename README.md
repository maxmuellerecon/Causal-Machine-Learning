## Usage

To get started, create and activate the environment with
```console
$ conda/mamba env create
$ conda activate cml
```

To build the project, type
```console
$ pytask
```

## Description

This contains the code for the final project of the "EPP" course at the University of Bonn. \
However, this repository is also a starting point for people interested in causal machine learning in python.
